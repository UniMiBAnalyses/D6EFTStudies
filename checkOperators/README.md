# Check operators

If you're wondering which operators may enter your set of Feynman Diagrams, we have the perfect solution for you!

Run `create1Dfolders.py` to know which operators match your process line (L85 and L104).


Either specify in `switchOn` the subset of operators you want to check, or wait half of your life for Madgraph to check if there are `No amplitudes found`.
 

Requirements:
1. Having MadGraph v2.6.5 (or higher) downloaded in D6EFTStudies/ and all the 1D restrict cards inserted inside its models.
2. Having time to waste :)
